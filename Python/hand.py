class Hand():
    '''
    This class describes the cards in each of the player's hands
    It contains three properties:
        - "cards" which is a list of card objects that are in that hand object
        - "value" which is the total value of the cards in the hand object
        - "aces" which is the total number of aces in the hand object
    It also contains two public methods:
        - "add_card" which adds the given card to the hand and checks for the aces in the hand
        - "adjust_for_ace" which depending on the total value of the hand chooses \
        whether ace should count as 1 or 11
